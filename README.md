**tldr; gadflai is AI-powered Not-Scrum**

# Overview

`gadflai` is an experimental, AI-centric alternative to existing software
development project management. Our goal is to manage software projects in a way
that emphasizes high-quality, natural language communication between
highly-skilled and competent contributors, encourages flat hierarchies, and
minimizes non-technical overhead.
